"Big and Chewy"

Amazing flavors! From Lemon cookies to the every popular Snickerdoodle. Be sure to get there early. They bake what they bake and thats it for the day. My favorite are the Lemon Cookies not overpowering great flavor and chewy. Yum Yum Yum. Be sure to bring the milk as they do not sell it there.
