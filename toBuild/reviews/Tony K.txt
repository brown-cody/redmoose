We were wine tasting and one of our servers mentioned Red Moose Cookie Company. She recommended us to go there since we were staying in Cambria... we decided to check it out before heading back home and it was absolutely awesome!

The Red Moose Cookie Company is located in an unconventional space right in the middle of what's seems to be warehouse/storage space, in the middle a an industrial zone. 

It's a very small place filled with some of the best cookies.

Once the owner realized this was our first time, he began to go into the history of this place- AMAZING STORY! Let's just say, Shark Tank approaches him and he turned them down. His reasoning was, "why should I have them invest when I own all the recipes, the company is all paid off, and I'm about to take this company and franchise it with a waiting list of people to partner." 

Good enough for me!
