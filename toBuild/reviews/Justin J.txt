Red Moose Cookies are a guaranteed stop for me on every layover in Cambria.  

Store is located in a storage unit just on the outskirts of town. Hard to pay the lease on nicer digs while slangin' cookies I imagine.

Staff is always pleasant and helpful. I will be back as the fat kid inside continues to rage on.
